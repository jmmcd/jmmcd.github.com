I'm a researcher with interests in evolutionary computation,
analytics, machine learning, and computational creativity. I'm
especially interested in the study of representations and fitness
landscapes for evolutionary algorithms, genetic programming,
optimisation and graph problems, and interactive evolutionary
computation as a tool in creative workflows.

I have done research in the University of Limerick, University College
Dublin, and Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

I am interested in talking to potential students about opportunities
to pursue PhD research at UCD in areas that match my research
interests. Some keywords: automatic programming; machine learning;
evolutionary computation; grammatical methods; graphs and networks;
network security; art, music and design; regression and
classification; analytics; minimum description length; optimisation;
metaheuristics. Tax-free
funding is available. Please contact me with a CV if interested.
