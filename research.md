I'm a researcher with interests in evolutionary computation,
analytics, machine learning, and computational creativity. I'm
especially interested in the study of representations and fitness
landscapes for evolutionary algorithms, genetic programming,
optimisation and graph problems, and interactive evolutionary
computation as a tool in creative workflows.

I have done research in the University of Limerick, University College
Dublin, and Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

I have opportunities for talented students with similar research
interests to work towards a PhD under my supervision in UCD.  Tax-free
funding is available. Please contact me with a CV if interested.
