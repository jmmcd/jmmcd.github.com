I'm a researcher with interests in evolutionary computation,
analytics, and computational creativity. I'm especially interested in
the study of representations and fitness landscapes for evolutionary
algorithms, graph problems, and interactive evolutionary computation
as a tool in creative workflows.

I am interested in talking to potential students about opportunities
to pursue PhD research at UCD in areas that match my research
interests. Some keywords: machine learning; evolutionary computation;
grammatical methods; graphs and networks; network security; art, music
and design; regression and classification; analytics; minimum
description length; optimisation; metaheuristics.

I've worked and studied at:

* the National University of Ireland, Galway (BSc in computer science
and mathematics);

* Hewlett-Packard, Galway, Ireland (automated install and system
management for supercomputers);

* University of Limerick (PhD in evolutionary control of sound
synthesis);

* University College Dublin (post-doctoral research in evolutionary
design);

* Massachusetts Institute of Technology (post-doctoral research in
evolutionary design); and currently:

* University College Dublin (Lecturer in Business Analytics, Quinn
  Business School).
