I'm a researcher with interests in evolutionary computation and
computational creativity. I'm especially interested in the study of
representations and fitness landscapes, and in interactive
evolutionary computation as a tool in creative workflows.

I've worked and studied at: 

* the National University of Ireland, Galway (BSc in computer science
and mathematics);

* Hewlett-Packard, Galway, Ireland (automated install and system
management for supercomputers);

* University of Limerick (PhD in evolutionary control of sound
synthesis); and

* Massachusetts Institute of Technology (post-doctoral research in
evolutionary design).

I'm currently in University College Dublin (post-doctoral research in
evolutionary design).
