I'm a researcher with interests in program synthesis, metaheuristic optimisation,
machine learning, and computational creativity. I'm
especially interested in the study of representations and fitness
landscapes for evolutionary algorithms, genetic programming,
optimisation and graph problems, and interactive evolutionary
computation as a tool in creative workflows. Some further keywords: automatic programming; machine learning;
evolutionary computation; grammatical evolution; art, music and design; regression and
classification; minimum description length; optimisation;
metaheuristics.

I am interested in talking to potential students about opportunities
to pursue PhD research at University of Galway in areas that match my research
interests. Opportunities for 
funding are sometimes available. Please contact me with a CV if interested, but make sure you describe precisely the overlap you see between your research interests and mine.
