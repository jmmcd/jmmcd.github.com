I'm a researcher with interests in metaheuristic optimisation,
machine learning, and computational creativity. I'm
especially interested in the study of representations and fitness
landscapes for evolutionary algorithms, genetic programming,
optimisation and graph problems, and interactive evolutionary
computation as a tool in creative workflows.

I am interested in talking to potential students about opportunities
to pursue PhD research at NUI Galway in areas that match my research
interests. Some keywords: automatic programming; machine learning;
evolutionary computation; grammatical methods; graphs and networks;
network security; art, music and design; regression and
classification; analytics; minimum description length; optimisation;
metaheuristics. Opportunities for 
funding are available. Please contact me with a CV if interested.
