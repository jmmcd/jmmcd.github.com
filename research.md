I'm a researcher with interests in evolutionary computation,
analytics, and computational creativity. I'm especially interested in
the study of representations and fitness landscapes for evolutionary
algorithms, graph problems, and interactive evolutionary computation
as a tool in creative workflows.

I've worked and studied at:

* the National University of Ireland, Galway (BSc in computer science
and mathematics);

* Hewlett-Packard, Galway, Ireland (automated install and system
management for supercomputers);

* University of Limerick (PhD in evolutionary control of sound
synthesis);

* University College Dublin (post-doctoral research in evolutionary
design);

* Massachusetts Institute of Technology (post-doctoral research in
evolutionary design); and currently:

* University College Dublin (Lecturer in Business Analytics, Quinn
  Business School).
