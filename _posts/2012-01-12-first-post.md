First Post
========

Here's a first post. I'm trying out github pages, which uses Jekyll to
generate a static site from templates and markdown content.



Some template tests
-------------------

Python highlighting using braces (formatting is correct, no
highlighting):

{% highlight python %}
#!/usr/bin/env python
print("hello")
# assign 5 to x
x = 5
{% endhighlight %}
