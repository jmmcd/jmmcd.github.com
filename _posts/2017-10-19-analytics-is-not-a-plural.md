Analytics: pluralist, but not a plural
========

(Some nit-picking on terminology.)

The term analytics means different things to different people. The term goes back to Aristotle's [Prior and Posterior Analytics](http://www.gutenberg.org/files/5500/5500-h/5500-h.htm), which is out of copyright and on Project Gutenberg, who knew. Francis Bacon refers to it too. Wikipedia says that in the current sense it means something like ["the discovery, interpretation, and communication of meaningful patterns in data"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytics), which is fair enough, and it's good to explicitly mention maths-n-stats and computing too, even if in principle they're only implementation details.

Some people take a narrow view of analytics, that it's [basically statistics applied to business](https://blogs.sas.com/content/sascom/2015/04/01/build-data-science-dream-team/), but I and the [UCD MSc in Business Analytics](http://smurfitschool.ie/businessanalytics) take a broad, pluralist, catholic view, including pretty much all of traditional operations research, such as exact and heuristic optimisation, and simulation methods; broader than just quantitative methods, e.g. including decision science including multi-criteria decision-making, behavioural approaches, and so on as part of analytics too.

For short, I like to say that analytics is about making decisions -- better. That dramatic em-dash is my way of distinguishing myself from Davenport, who rightly reduced it to this essence a long time ago in ["Make better decisions"](https://hbr.org/2009/11/make-better-decisions-2).

Regardless of your favourite definition, there's one bone I have to pitck with  Davenport, and that is his use of *analytics* as a plural. For example, in Harris and Davenport, *Competing on Analytics* 2nd edition, writing about HMH, they say that before HMH's analytics transformation, there were "few analytics" to inform and motivate employees and management. (It's not a once-off or a typo.)

Now [Dictionary.com](http://www.dictionary.com/browse/-ics) gives:
"*"-ics"*: a suffix of nouns that denote a body of facts, knowledge, principles, etc., usually corresponding to adjectives ending in *-ic*, or *-ical*: ethics; physics; politics; tactics."

Further examples include mathematics and economics. *Analytics* fits in this pattern. It's a singular noun, just like all the rest. We don't say *economics are so difficult*, or *I used a mathematic earlier today in my everyday life* (not just because is that even possible), and nor should we say *analytics help managers to make good decisions" or *which is your favourite analytic?*. I think people who say these things are slightly conflating analytics with metrics. Analytics is not just metrics. (Metrics is a genuine plural, and I won't go into the distinction between metrics as used in business (more like some kind of generalisation of [norms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norm_(mathematics)#Generalizations), if anything!) and [metrics in the mathematical sense](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_(mathematics)).)

How does *analytics* differ from *analysis*? Well first, what is analysis? Analysis means understanding something by taking it apart, in some ways the opposite of synthesis. From [Oxford dictionary](https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/analysis): Analysis (noun): detailed examination of the elements or structure of something ... late 16th century: via medieval Latin from Greek *analusis*, from *analuein* 'unloose', from *ana- 'up' + *luein* 'loosen'. One definition, which is at least internally coherent and coherent with terms like economics and mathematics, is that analytics is *the study of methods of* analysis. (Whatever you do, don't confuse business analysis with business analytics!)
