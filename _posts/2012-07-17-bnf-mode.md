BNF-mode
========

I do a lot of writing and editing of context-free grammars in BNF
format, eg for my work on Grammatical Evolution (examples
[here](https://code.google.com/p/ponyge/) and
[here](http://ncra.ucd.ie/Site/GEVA.html)). 

I was amazed to find that there's no Emacs mode for editing
BNF. Here's a small contribution which does some syntax
highlighting. It also lives at
[EmacsWiki](http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs-en/BNFMode).

{% highlight scheme %}

(define-generic-mode 'bnf-mode
  () ;; comment char: inapplicable because # must be at start of line
  nil ;; keywords
  '(
    ("^#.*" . 'font-lock-comment-face) ;; comments at start of line
    ("^<.*?>" . 'font-lock-function-name-face) ;; LHS nonterminals
    ("<.*?>" . 'font-lock-builtin-face) ;; other nonterminals
    ("::=" . 'font-lock-warning-face) ;; "goes-to" symbol
    ("\|" . 'font-lock-warning-face) ;; "OR" symbol
    ("\{:\\|:\}" . 'font-lock-keyword-face) ;; special pybnf delimiters
    )
  '("\\.bnf\\'" "\\.pybnf\\'") ;; filename suffixes
  nil ;; extra function hooks
  "Major mode for BNF highlighting.")

{% endhighlight %}

Installation
------------

Paste it into your `.emacs` file and execute it with `C-x C-e`. When
you edit a `.bnf` file, it will automatically go into BNF-mode.
