I write music (rock, electronic):

* [My YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5ZYG6VXoYJw0wNc7PzS83A) contains my most recent music
* [My soundcloud page](http://soundcloud.com/jmmcd) has some more
* [More music](http://www.skynet.ie/~jmmcd/music.html), older

And I write programs that write music:

* [Drum pattern interpolation with neural networks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kzbQI2LiOk)
* [XG, a generative music project](http://www.skynet.ie/~jmmcd/xg.html)
