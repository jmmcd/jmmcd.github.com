I'm a researcher in analytics, evolutionary computation and
computational creativity. I also write music and I write programs that
write music.

I am the programme director for the
[UCD MSc in Business Analytics](http://www.smurfitschool.ie/businessanalytics/). It
teaches descriptive, predictive, and prescriptive analytics, with
foundational material, many applications, and advanced research. We
have world-class faculty and close to full employment of
graduates. Please see the above link or contact me for more
information.

I also have opportunities for talented students with well-aligned
research interests to work towards a PhD under my supervision in UCD.
Tax-free funding is available. Please see
[my research interests](/research.html) and contact me with a CV if
interested.


I've worked and studied at:

* the National University of Ireland, Galway (BSc in computer science
and mathematics);

* Hewlett-Packard, Galway, Ireland (automated install and system
management for supercomputers, at the time the fastest in the world);

* University of Limerick (PhD in evolutionary control of sound
synthesis);

* University College Dublin (post-doctoral research in evolutionary
