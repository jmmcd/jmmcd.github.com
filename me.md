I'm a researcher in metaheuristic optimisation, machine learning, and
computational creativity. I also write music and I write programs that
write music.

I'm a lecturer in Computer Science in the College of Engineering and Informatics, National University of Ireland, Galway. I teach on the MSc in Data Analytics and MSc in Artificial Intelligence.

I'm interested in supervising/mentoring researchers at undergrad, MSc, PhD, or post-doc level. Please see
[my research interests](/research.html) and contact me with a CV if
interested.


I've previously worked and studied at:

* the National University of Ireland, Galway (BSc in computer science
and mathematics);

* Hewlett-Packard, Galway, Ireland (automated install and system
management for supercomputers, at the time the fastest in the world);

* University of Limerick (PhD in evolutionary control of sound
synthesis);

* University College Dublin (post-doctoral research in evolutionary
