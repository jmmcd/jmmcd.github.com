I'm a researcher in metaheuristic optimisation, machine learning, and
computational creativity. I also write music and I write programs that
write music.

I'm a lecturer in the School of Computer Science in the College of Science and Engineering, University of Galway, in the west of Ireland. I teach mostly on the MSc in Data Analytics and MSc in Artificial Intelligence (classroom and online), and I'm the Programme Directory for the MSc in Artificial Intelligence (online).

I'm interested in supervising/mentoring researchers at undergrad, MSc, PhD, or post-doc level. Please see
[my research interests](/research.html) and contact me with a CV if
interested.

* University of Galway (then known as University College Galway and later the National University of Ireland, Galway) (BSc in computer science
and mathematics);

* Hewlett-Packard, Galway, Ireland (automated install and system
management for supercomputers, at the time the fastest in the world);
