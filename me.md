I'm a researcher in program synthesis, metaheuristic optimisation, machine learning, and
computational creativity. I also write music and I write programs that
write music.

I'm a lecturer in the School of Computer Science in the College of Science and Engineering, University of Galway, in the west of Ireland. I teach mostly on the MSc in Data Analytics and MSc in Artificial Intelligence (classroom and online), and I'm the Programme Director for the [MSc in Artificial Intelligence (Online)](https://www.universityofgalway.ie/courses/taught-postgraduate-courses/online-artificial-intelligence.html). 

I'm interested in supervising/mentoring researchers at undergrad, MSc, PhD, or post-doc level. Please see
[my research interests](/research.html) and contact me with a CV if
interested.
