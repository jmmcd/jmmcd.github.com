Lee Cronin is a good example of someone whose research should be shut down!

@Dominic Cummings

The attitudes to safety in the Cronin interview with Lex Fridman are not good.

Eg 100% sure that something is safe.

Eg even if a nano-particle escapes his chemputer and becomes self-replicating - "who cares" - because it would be using a different chemistry. Without realising that there could be some intersection between the elements and materials it would use and those we do (biologically or in our industry and society).

Red flags everywhere.
